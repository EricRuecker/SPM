# Spacetime Pressure Model (SPM)

> A Unified Cosmological Theory by Eric Ruecker  
> 📡 Reproduces galaxy dynamics, expansion, and CMB structure — without dark matter or dark energy

## 🔭 Overview

The **Spacetime Pressure Model (SPM)** introduces a pressure-based framework for cosmology, where baryonic mass sources a spacetime pressure field that drives curvature, structure formation, and large-scale expansion. Through simulation and mathematical modeling, SPM demonstrates that observed galactic behavior and cosmic microwave background (CMB) structure can emerge from pressure effects alone.

## 🧪 Key Features

- ✅ Explains **flat galaxy rotation curves** with no dark matter
- ✅ Simulates **gravitational lensing** using pressure field curvature
- ✅ Reproduces **large-scale structure formation** and galactic collapse
- ✅ Accurately models **cosmic expansion** from a pressure recoil function \( a(t) \)
- ✅ Hits the **first acoustic CMB peak** \( \ell_1 \approx 220 \) without ΛCDM assumptions

## 📊 Final CMB Results

| Quantity                  | Value       |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Sound Horizon \( r_s \)        | 0.05234     |
| Angular Distance \( d_A \)     | 3.6072      |
| Acoustic Peak \( \ell_1 \)     | 216.50      |
| Acoustic Peak \( \ell_2 \)     | 433.01      |
| Acoustic Peak \( \ell_3 \)     | 649.51      |

> Derived entirely from pressure, temperature, magnetic drag, and structure feedback.

## 💡 How It Works

- **Pressure fields** sourced by Higgs-coupled baryonic mass
- **Fusion ignition** builds galactic mass via pressure-confined heating
- **Structure formation** driven by inward momentum and confinement core
- **CMB peaks** emerge naturally from photon sound horizon and drag decay

## 🧠 Why It Matters

SPM demonstrates that pressure and curvature effects from known physics can explain the entire observable structure of the universe — from galaxies to CMB peaks — without resorting to hypothetical particles or vacuum energies. It provides a computational, transparent, and reproducible path forward for cosmology.
